* Location: *Shanghai, China* | *Seoul, Korea*
* Interests: `Computer Architecture` | `Compiler Engineering`

#### Profile
Hello, I am Jinlock Choi, a Compiler Engineer specializing in LLVM backend development and architecture-aware optimizations. I have a strong foundation in computer architecture, complemented by a minor in computer science, giving me a broad and deep understanding of computing systems. I am experienced in developing optimization passes tailored to target architectures, and I have hands-on knowledge of processor design principles. In addition, I am proficient in C/C++, Git, and collaborative development workflows, and have demonstrated strong communication and teamwork skills through various academic and industry projects.

## Employment

### **Shanghai Taize Semiconductor Co., Ltd (上海泰则半导体有限公司), Shanghai**
Shanghai Taize Semiconductor Co., Ltd. is an AI accelerator design startup based in Shanghai, China.

#### *Compiler Engineer*
* July 2025 - Present

#### *Compiler Engineer Intern - LLVM backend*
* January 2025 - June 2025
* **Evaluation of LLVM Machine Code Sinking on a Custom VLIW Processor**  
Analyzed LLVM’s MachineSinking pass to identify performance bottlenecks and optimization challenges on the company’s under-development chip architecture.
* Implemented a new built-in instruction and corresponding intrinsics for the company's LLVM backend.  

Through the internship, I have gained experience with VLIW and TPU architecture, compiler-based instruction scheduling, and the fundamental structure and functionality of the open-source compiler project LLVM
